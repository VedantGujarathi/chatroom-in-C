# chatroom-in-C
THis project is build on the linux environment 
IF you have linux then you can run this project by simply insatalling GNU compiler for C. 
First you have to run a server code and then client code on other device
note: sometime server code may not work in virtual box you need to have a complete linux on your device. thats becouse it is based on TCP Ip model and virtual box takes internet connnective by sharing it from windows so it will not work properly.
